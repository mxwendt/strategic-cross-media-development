<p><strong>In your words what is the media industry based on your thoughts, the reading, the videos?</strong></p>

<p>Companies that belong to the media industry all have one thing in common: they work with content in some way. It can be generated, distributed and/or aggregated by the company. And there are some companies that empower people to generate and share their own content. But for the most part people are only consuming in a mostly passive way. Therefore the media industry is always adapting to bring a satisfying user experience to its consumers independent of medium or format.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think are the key challenges to be faced for media companies in the future?</strong></p>

<p>The key challenges to be faced by media companies in the future all have to do with staying relevant and profitable in a fast-paced digital world. Since content is perishable they always need to find ways to produce new content people want to consume, they need to develop or improve upon tools so that people can take advantage of new technologies or establish or improve upon media platforms.
To fulfill this goal media companies have to stay on top of inventions that have the potential to change the rules that define their market today or even make a market irrelevant all together. Classifying these inventions into technologies, products or services that will either supplement or substitute the current offerings is a must. Distribution methods, revenue models, user behavior, user relationships, value generation and social objectives are all possible factors that may or may not be affected by that. And for most companies that are not established in the their market yet, one of the biggest challenges will be getting recognized in the first place. Getting user attention will only be getting harder in the future.<br />
Besides all these challenges, one thing that all media companies should strive for is: satisfying the demand for structured and rich informations.</p>

<p><strong>How will you go about learning about these challenges?</strong></p>

<p>To learn about these challenges it is necessary to gather information and form an opinion. Find good sources and take notes while reading books and articles, watching videos and talks and look at the news that are relevant to this topic. Then write about it and try to set everything in perspective and see how everything relates to each other. Look at what happened in the past and what is most likely to be relevant in the future. Are there patterns emerging or are there indications of a major shift that will occur in the near future that could be acted upon? Identify niche technologies, products, services or platforms that have potential in a few years. Or look what how major players of today behave and how they have evolved.<br />
Donâ€™t shy away to discuss it publicly. Stay open minded to other ideas and look for feedback. Be aware that opinions can and should change when there is new relevant information or a new important context.</p>

<p><strong>What are your expectations for the course and program connected to the above?</strong></p>
