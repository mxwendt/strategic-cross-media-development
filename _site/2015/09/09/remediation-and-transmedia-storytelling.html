<p>The central themes in <em>Remediation</em> by J. R. Bolter and R. Grusin and <em>Searching for the Origami Unicorn</em> by H. Jenkins revolve around a constant representation of content through different media. To understand what that means today, it is important to consider the cultural assumptions about immediacy and hypermediacy, the appreciation of interplay of different mediums and the status quo of technology. Since the World Wide Web is a platform to share content in digital media forms, from simple texts to interactive video, it is particularly favorable to illustrate the concept of remediation and transmedia storytelling.</p>

<p>Remediation can basically be two things. Either it is a representation of one medium in another or it is taking content from one medium and reuse it in another. Looking at an image on a website, the digital representation of the image can function as a way to access the original representation of the image. On the other hand, an video on a website that shows a collage of images and texts, takes the content from the original medium and repurposes it without necessarily acknowledging its origin. Either way the original image was remediated. But the difference is not only the actual content of the image, but different emphases of immediacy and hypermediacy. A medium is immediate, when the viewer is not aware of the medium, but only sees the content. Thus the goal of a digital image, that is merely a mediator, is to be transparent to the viewer. On the opposite hypermediacy is the awareness of the medium by the viewer. Seeing the same original image in a video makes it impossible for the viewer to not be aware of the new medium. Finally, one of the fundamental characteristics of the World Wide Web is its interconnectivity. Visitors are always just a single step away from jumping from one content to another or changing from one medium to another. The interplay of reading a text, watching a video or playing an online game generally enriches content.</p>

<p>If done right, transmedia storytelling is the ultimate form of interplay of media. Representing content in a way that suits the medium at hand, allows for a more immersive experience. To accomplish a conclusive story through all kinds of media, it is necessary to generate a fictional world that a person can explore. For example, The Matrix from the Wachowskis consists of three movies, a computer game, comics and a huge fan base that was eager to gather information, no matter the medium. Only watching the movies did not give you the whole picture of what it was all about. But thanks to the viral nature of the internet fans were able to exchange and gather valuable insides to eventually complete the picture.</p>

<p>I think, remediation and transmedia storytelling are common patterns by now, no matter if you are actually aware of them or not.</p>
